abstract = {A number of subjective and objective methods have been proposed to determine the roundness of rock particles, roundness being one of three properties describing the shape of a particle. Methods that make use ofthe Fourier transform of the polar coordinates of particles' edge elements are proposed in this paper. Lowpass filters are used to smooth the profiles of rock particle, roundness is then determined from the differences between the original and smooth profiles. Further methods that are proposed make use of different measures of inequality to quantify the distribution of the energy among the transform coefficients of the profiles of rock particles. These values are then used to determine the roundness of the particles. Entropy and Emlen's modified entropy are the measures of inequality that are used. Different methods of determining the centre point of a particle and different methods to interpolate the edge elements are compared. The sensitivity of the methods to different resolutions is also investigated. The results obtained with the proposed methods are comparable to those obtained with an existing Fourier transform based method, however it is shown that the proposed methods are computationally less demanding. It is also shown that the proposed methods are better than the existing method when the comparison is based on the correlation between the mean roundness of samples of particles and the actual roundness of the particles. {\textcopyright} Springer Science {\&} Business Media, Inc. 2007.},

abstract = {Particle morphological features at different scale levels hold the key to understanding the geological origin and mechanical behaviour of natural sands. In this context, it is necessary to characterise and quantify these morphological features by defining a series of reasonable descriptors. In this study, based on X-ray micro-computed tomographic ($\mu$CT) images collected from a series of image-processing techniques, the authors first introduced spherical harmonic analysis to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) realistic surface of the sand particles. Then 3D sphericity, roundness and fractal dimension were introduced to define the global form, local features and surface textures of the particle morphology. Based on the spherical harmonic-reconstructed surface, a novel framework was established to measure the descriptors of 3D sphericity, roundness and fractal dimension of sand particles. The 3D fractal dimension was an original descriptor used to characterise the fractal nature of the surface textures of real sand particle morphology. By using the proposed methods, these morphological descriptors were measured for two types of natural sand particle. The statistical results show clear correlations between different descriptors at different characteristic scales. The correlation relies heavily upon the distance between the characteristic scales of the morphological descriptors.},

abstract = {In this article we develop a mathematical method based on image analysis to measure the textural properties of heavy minerals in fluvial, eolian-dune, and beach sediments throughout the 1800-km-long Orange cell of littoral sand transport, the longest documented so far on our planet. We analyzed the grain size and shape of 12,700 grains, including all major heavy-mineral species contained in 22 selected samples collected along the Atlantic coast, from Namibia to southern Angola. In this unique natural laboratory, where the Orange River represents a single dominant sediment source characterized by diagnostic compositional fingerprints, hyperarid climate ensures limited chemical alteration of even unstable ferromagnesian minerals. This case study led us to: a) monitor changes in grain size and roundness of various detrital minerals during ultralong transport in high-energy shallow-marine and eolian environments; b) determine the relative durability of various detrital minerals to mechanical wear as a function of their mineralogical properties (e.g., hardness, cleavability); c) compare roundness of grains in sands of different facies to establish the relative efficiency of mechanical processes as a function of depositional environment and transporting medium (i.e., water versus air); d) compare roundness of the same detrital species in beach deposits enriched in heavy minerals to different degrees and evaluate whether rounded grains are preferentially entrained or left behind during high-energy storm events; e) test the use of textural properties to distinguish between coarser or angular grains of local provenance from smaller or rounded grains derived from distant sources. The rigorous definition of particle shape and the measurement of grain roundness is a necessary step to achieve a full understanding of sedimentary processes, evaluate mechanical effects during long-distance transport, challenge untested assumptions, and obtain useful complementary information on sediment provenance.

Even if this is known, there has been only minor progress in explaining the processes behind its performance and has only partly implemented in practical geotechnical analysis. This literature review covers different methods and techniques used to determine the geometrical shape of the particles. Particle shape could be classifying in three categories; sphericity-the overall particle shape and similitude with a sphere, roundness-the description of the particle's corners and roughness-the surface texture of the particle. The categories are scale dependent and the major scale is to sphericity while the minor belongs to roughness. The overview has shown that there is no agreement on the usage of the descriptors and is not clear which descriptor is the best. One problem has been in a large scale classify shape properties. Image analysis seems according to the review to be a promising tool, it has advantages as low time consumption or repeatability. But the resolution in the processed image needs to be considered since it influences descriptors such as e.g. the perimeter.

abstract = {One of the major challenges in nanomedicine is to improve nanoparticle cell selectivity and adhesion efficiency through designing functionalized nanoparticles of controlled sizes, shapes, and material compositions. Recent data on cylindrically shaped filomicelles are beginning to show that nonspherical particles remarkably improved the biological properties over spherical counterpart. Despite these exciting advances, non-spherical particles have not been widely used in nanomedicine applications due to the lack of fundamental understanding of shape effect on targeting efficiency. This paper intends to investigate the shape-dependent adhesion kinetics of non-spherical nanoparticles through computational modeling. The ligand-receptor binding kinetics is coupled with Brownian dynamics to study the dynamic delivery process of nanorods under various vascular flow conditions. The influences of nanoparticle shape, ligand density, and shear rate on adhesion probability are studied. Nanorods are observed to contact and adhere to the wall much easier than their spherical counterparts under the same configuration due to their tumbling motion. The binding probability of a nanorod under a shear rate of 8 s -1 is found to be three times higher than that of a nanosphere with the same volume. The particle binding probability decreases with increased flow shear rate and channel height. The Brownian motion is found to largely enhance nanoparticle binding. Results from this study contribute to the fundamental understanding and knowledge on how particle shape affects the transport and targeting efficiency of nanocarriers, which will provide mechanistic insights on the design of shape-specific nanomedicine for targeted drug delivery applications.

abstract = {Sand response depends on particle morphology (size and shape). In geotechnical research and practice, size is typically assessed by sieve analysis and particle shapes are qualitatively described. Technological developments mean that digital images of sand particles can easily be obtained, enabling shape to be quantified. The complexity associated with many digital image analysis algorithms seems to have restricted their use to fundamental research studies. This study introduces a pragmatic approach for quantitative shape analysis that has the potential to be broadly adopted in geotechnical engineering research and practice. The approach generates three shape measures (convexity, sphericity, and aspect ratio) that can easily be calculated from digital images. Following an analysis of these shape measures and the imaging method used here, a database of 36 sands, including many of the sands commonly used in geotechnical research, is presented. The subjective nature of qualitative description is clear from the discrepancies that were found in published shape assessments of these sands. Convexity, sphericity, and aspect ratio data for each of the 36 sands are presented. The relevance of these parameters to geotechnical engineering is established by comparing them with widely used qualitative descriptions. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The evaluation of hydrologie model behaviour and performance is commonly made and reported through comparisons of simulated and observed variables. Frequently, comparisons are made between simulated and measured streamflow at the catchment outlet. In distributed hydrological modelling approaches, additional comparisons of simulated and observed measurements for multi-response validation may be integrated into the evaluation procedure to assess overall modelling performance. In both approaches, single and multi-response, efficiency criteria are commonly used by hydrologists to provide an objective assessment of the "closeness" of the simulated behaviour to the observed measurements. While there are a few efficiency criteria such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, coefficient of determination, and index of agreement that are frequently used in hydrologie modeling studies and reported in the literature, there are a large number of other efficiency criteria to choose from. The selection and use of specific efficiency criteria and the interpretation of the results can be a challenge for even the most experienced hydrologist since each criterion may place different emphasis on different types of simulated and observed behaviours. In this paper, the utility of several efficiency criteria is investigated in three examples using a simple observed streamflow hydrograph.},

Materials and methods: Individual characterization and quantification of foramen magnum shapes in direct caudal view based on elliptical Fourier technique was applied to 46 tropical raccoon skulls (26 females, 20 males). Results: Incremental number of harmonics demonstrates morphological contributions of such descriptors with their relations to specific anatomical constructions established. The initial harmonics (1st to 3rd) described the general foramen shapes while the second (4th to 12th) demonstrated fine morphological details. Sexual-size dimorphism was observed in females (87.1{\%}) and 91.7{\%} in males, normalization of size produces 75{\%} in females and 83{\%} in males. With respect to foramen magnum dimorphism analysis, the result obtained through elliptic Fourier analysis was comparatively better in detail information of outline contours than earlier classical methods. The first four effective principal components defined 70.63{\%} of its shape properties while the rest (22.51{\%}) constituted fine details of morphology. Conclusion: Both size and shape seems important in sexual dimorphisms in this species, this investigation suggest clinical implications, taxonomic and anthropologic perspectives in foramen characterization magnum characterization and further postulates an increased possibility of volume reduction cerebellar protrusion, ontogenic magnum shape irregularities in the sample population with neurologic consequences especially among females.},

abstract = {In this paper, an algorithm for clast roundness classification based on the Radon transform is presented. The degree of roundness is determined by processing the sinogram of the clast image. The algorithm consists in applying two low-pass filters to the sinogram, obtaining the inverse Radon transform and comparing the filtered images with the original image. For rounded particles, the difference between the original image and either of the filtered images will be small. For angular clasts, the difference will be greater than for rounded clasts, due to the presence of high-frequency components. In the comparison process, each of the two filtered images are subtracted from the original image to yield two difference images. Since the data are binary, these two images present topologically unconnected regions that correspond to the particle's edges. The percentage of non-overlapping area between the original and the difference images, and the number of regions are used to classify the morphology of the clast. The results have been validated using a comparison chart designed for visual roundness estimation. The comparison chart, consisting of five roundness classes, was proposed by Russell, Taylor and, Pettijohn (M{\"{u}}ller, 1967). Two cutoff frequencies, one to classify well-rounded, rounded and sub-rounded clasts and another for angular and sub-angular classes, were used. The proposed algorithm correctly classifies the roundness classes of the visual graph. The results provided by the algorithm were compared with the classification performed by a group of experts. The algorithm assigned 92{\%} of the clasts to the same classes as the human experts. We also propose Gaussian models, which are useful to classify the particles into the five classes. We have developed a user-friendly software to carry out the roundness classification algorithm. This software was developed on the MATLAB platform and can be freely downloaded from the public repository.},

abstract = {• Background and Aims: Petals are important for Primula sieboldii because of the commercial value of its flowers, and their form is a target characteristic for breeding. An appropriate understanding of petal form in terms of genetic mechanisms and environmental effects is necessary for improvement of this species. The aim of this study was to establish a quantitative evaluation method of petal shape by elliptic Fourier descriptors and principal component analysis (EF-PCA), and thus to investigate genotypic and environmental effects on petal morphology. • Methods: EF-PCA describes an overall shape mathematically by transforming coordinate information concerning its contours into elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) and summarizing the EFDs by principal component analysis. To examine varietal effects on principal component (PC) scores and petal area among commercial varieties, nested ANOVAs were performed (since the samples had a hierarchical structure with four sources, i.e. variety, plant, flower and petal). • Key Results: Petal shape variation could be evaluated successfully and the symmetrical and asymmetrical elements of the overall shape variation could be detected. The proportions of the variance component due to varietal differences were more than 70 {\%} in the first five PCs of the symmetrical elements and petal area. By contrast, the proportions due to varietal effects of all PCs of the asymmetrical elements were less than 20 {\%}, and the proportions of the variation within a flower were more than 75 {\%}. It was also demonstrated that the yearly variance of petal shape was small, and that of petal area was large. • Conclusions: Within a flower the major source of the symmetrical elements is genotypic and the asymmetrical elements are strongly affected by the environment. With respect to petal area, the contribution of genotypes is also large; it is, however, affected by the macro-environment more notably than is petal shape. {\textcopyright} 2004 Annals of Botany Company.},

abstract = {This survey proposes a new approach to identify buried caldera boundaries of a volcanic cone, combining (1) a systematic elliptic Fourier functions (EFF) analysis on the contour lines based on the external shape of the edifice with (2) self-potential (SP) measurements on volcano flanks. The methodology of this approach is to investigate the relationships between (1) vertical morphological changes inferred from EFF analysis and (2) lateral lithological transition inside the edifice inferred from SP/elevation gradients. The application of these methods on Misti volcano in southern Peru displays a very good correlation. The three main boundaries evidenced by hierarchical cluster analysis on the contour lines coincide with the two main boundaries characterised by SP signal and with a secondary SP signature related with a summit caldera. In order to explain these results showing a very good correlation between morphologic and lithologic changes as function of elevation, caldera boundaries have been suggested. The latter would be located at an average elevation of (1) 4350-4400 m, (2) 4950-5000 m, and (3) 5500-5550 m. For the lowest boundary in elevation, the coincidence with the lateral extension of the hydrothermal system inferred from SP measurements suggests that caldera walls act as a barrier for lateral extension of hydrothermal systems. In the summit area, the highest boundary has been related with the summit caldera, inferred by a secondary SP minimum and geological evidence. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A new chain code for shapes composed of regular cells is defined. This boundary chain code is based on the numbers of cell vertices which are in touch with the bounding contour of the shape. This boundary chain code is termed vertex chain code (VCC). The VCC is invariant under translation and rotation. Also, it may be starting point normalized and invariant under mirroring transformation. Using this concept of chain code it is possible to relate the chain length to the contact perimeter, which corresponds to the sum of the boundaries of neighboring cells of the shape (Bribiesca, E., Comp. Math. Appl. 33(11) (1997) 1-9); also, to relate the chain nodes to the contact vertices, which correspond to the vertices of neighboring cells. So, in this way, these relations among the chain and the characteristics of interior of the shape allow us to obtain interesting properties. This work is motivated by the idea of obtaining various shape features computed directly from the VCC without going to Cartesian-coordinate representation. Finally, in order to illustrate the capabilities of the VCC: we present some results using real shapes. {\textcopyright} 1999 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The same thing can not be said about the newly emerging multimedia and image database systems. One of the central concerns in these systems is the automatic characterization of image content and retrieval of images based on similarity of image content. In this paper, we discuss effectiveness of several shape measures for content based similarity retrieval of images. The different shape measures we have implemented include outline based features (chain code based string features, Fourier descriptors, UNL Fourier features), region based features (invariant moments, Zernike moments, pseudo-Zernike moments), and combined features (invariant moments {\&} Fourier descriptors, invariant moments {\&} UNL Fourier features). Given an image, all these shape feature measures (vectors) are computed automatically, and the feature vector can either be used for the retrieval purpose or can be stored in the database for future queries. We have tested all of the above shape features for image retrieval on a database of 500 trademark images. The average retrieval efficiency values computed over a set of fifteen representative queries for all the methods is presented. The output of a sample shape similarity query using all the features is also shown. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The morphometry of volcanic ash produced by explosive eruptions yields ample information on fragmentation processes (e.g. magmatic vs magma-water interactions), and on transport and sedimentation mechanisms. Most previous works on volcanic clast morphometry focused on the Apparent (2D-)Projected shape of ASH grains, here termed APASH, to infer processes and eruptive styles. However, textural analyses of ash grains has remained a long and tedious task that made such approaches inappropriate for eruption surveillance duties. In this work we show that new technological advances on automated dispersion of granular materials imaged with a camera-coupled microscope and enhanced computer capabilities enable fast and high resolution image acquisition of thousands of ash grains that resolve this limitation. With a morpho-grainsizer designed for such fast and routine measurements we perform a series of APASH analyses on selected ash fractions of tephra deposits from known eruptive styles. We record the size, aspect ratio, circularity and convexity of APASH images and assess resolution, reproducibility, minimum population size, and total analytical duration, and offer recommendations for the reporting of APASH data for inter-laboratory comparisons. To avoid fractal geometry concerns, our analyses are carried out at constant size range (250-300. $\mu$m) and optical magnification (×. 5) on {\~{}}. 3000 grains per samples collected from homogenized samples. Results from the andesitic 1999-ongoing eruption of Tungurahua volcano (Ecuador) show that ash particles from the moderate 2001 phase are relatively equant and convex in shape, while the stronger 2006 subplinian phase produced ash grains with more elongated, less circular and less convex APASH signatures. Ash grains from a basaltic scoria cone-forming eruption show even more ragged APASH characteristics. Overall, our protocol allows obtaining accurate and reproducible morphometric measurements that reveal subtle variations of the morphological signature, and the short duration (1.8. hours) of the whole analytical process renders high resolution analyses of ash shape achievable for volcano surveillance applications. This research ultimately aims to set up a morphometric database of APASH results for well-defined eruptive styles, in order to interpret on a short term basis any APASH data from active volcanoes for monitoring purposes.},

abstract = {A method that integrates elliptic Fourier and principal component analysis is a new development in the analysis of the shapes of sand grains. However, conventional elliptic Fourier and principal component analysis based on the variance-covariance matrix of the elliptic Fourier results can determine only the form of sand grains, and fails to quantify fine-scale boundary smoothness of grains. In this study, sand grains from glacial, fluvial, foreshore and aeolian environments were analysed using both elliptic Fourier and principal component analysis and an extension of elliptic Fourier and principal component analysis based on the correlation matrix to extract information on grain form (macroscopic) and grain boundary smoothness (microscopic) separately. Conventional elliptic Fourier and principal component analysis based on the variance-covariance matrix produces macroscopic particle shape descriptors, such as the elongation index and bump indices. These indices indicate that sand grains exposed to subaqueous transportation (fluvial and foreshore) have forms that are more elongated than those exposed to subaerial transportation (aeolian dunes). However, elliptic Fourier and principal component analysis based on the correlation matrix is, in addition, able to extract microscopic particle features, which can be interpreted in terms of a boundary smoothness index. The boundary smoothness index indicates that the surfaces of glacial grains are the most rugged, whereas the surfaces of aeolian grains are the smoothest. On bivariate plots of the boundary smoothness and elongation indices, samples from fluvial, foreshore, aeolian and glacial environments cluster in discrete regions. In addition, the analysis reveals that glacial grains are exposed to different morphological maturation pathways than those from fluvial, foreshore and aeolian environments.},

abstract = {With the effectiveness of therapeutic agents ever decreasing and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, there is a clear need for administration of more potent, potentially more toxic, drugs. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals may hold potential but require specialised protection from premature in vivo degradation. Thus, a paralleled need for specialised drug delivery systems has arisen. Although cell-mediated drug delivery is not a completely novel concept, the few applications described to date are not yet ready for in vivo application, for various reasons such as drug-induced carrier cell death, limited control over the site and timing of drug release and/or drug degradation by the host immune system. Here, we present our hypothesis for a new drug delivery system, which aims to negate these limitations. We propose transport of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs inside autologous macrophages polarised to M1 phenotype for high mobility and treated to induce transient phagosome maturation arrest. In addition, we propose a significant shift of existing paradigms in the study of host-microbe interactions, in order to study microbial host immune evasion and dissemination patterns for their therapeutic utilisation in the context of drug delivery. We describe a system in which microbial strategies may be adopted to facilitate absolute control over drug delivery, and without sacrificing the host carrier cells. We provide a comprehensive summary of the lessons we can learn from microbes in the context of drug delivery and discuss their feasibility for in vivo therapeutic application. We then describe our proposed “synthetic microbe drug delivery system” in detail. In our opinion, this multidisciplinary approach may hold the solution to effective, controlled drug delivery.},

Angular grain packs give rise to the best agreement with experimental measurements. Cement volume and its spatial distribution in the pore space significantly affect all calculated petrophysical properties. Available empirical permeability correlations for non-spherical grains underestimate permeability between 30 and 70 {\%} for the analyzed samples. Kozeny–Carman's predictions agree with modeled permeability for spherical grain packs but overestimate permeability for micro-CT images and non-spherical grain packs when volume-based radii are used to calculate the average grain size in a pack.

There is a continuous control of the linearity of the decision boundaries, from linear for small training sets to any degree of nonlinearity justified by larger training sets. A four-layer neural network of the type proposed can map any input pattern to any number of classifications. The input variables can be either continuous or binary. Modification of the decision boundaries based on new data can be accomplished in real time simply by defining a set of weights equal to the new training vector. The decision boundaries can be implemented using analog 'neurons', which operate entirely in parallel. The organization proposed takes into account the projected pin limitations of neural-net chips of the near future.

abstract = {An objective procedure is described for quantifying the shape of two‐dimensional closed curves from projections or sections of particles, e.g., sand grains. The curves are plotted in polar coordinates r and $\theta$, and a harmonic analysis is made of the function r($\theta$) by numerical analysis of measurements at equally spaced sample points along the curves. Quantities corresponding to the conventional properties of sphericity and roundness are derived from the Fourier coefficients. Three different measures of roundness are proposed and shown to correlate with visually estimated roundness classes, though also depending to some extent on sphericity. An attempt is described to study the interaction between these two properties by analysis of synthetically rounded plastic particles. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Autonomous image recognition has numerous potential applications in the field of planetary science and geology. During exploration, geologists could encounter an unknown rock and instead of having to bring back the sample to the laboratory for analysis, a better approach would be to have a mobile device classify the image of a rock. As well, instead of waiting a long time for a planetary rover to send back an image to Earth for classification, its on-board computer could have a software that could automatically classify images of outcrops. In 2017, Shu et. al. used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm to classify uniform rock images into 9 different classes with the image features extracted autonomously. Through this method, they achieved a classification accuracy of 96.71{\%}. Recent publications have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform better than other algorithms in classifying images of everyday objects, more specifically for the ImageNet dataset. In light of this development, this paper demonstrates the use of CNNs to classify the same set of rock images. With the addition of dataset augmentation, a 3-layer CNN is shown to have a significant improvement over Shu et. al.'s results, achieving an average accuracy of 99.60{\%} across 10 trials on the test set. Having proven that CNNs can classify uniform and clean images of rocks, this research then tackles a more interesting and practical problem in classifying natural scene images of rocks where the images are taken during field exploration without a standardized method and specialized equipment. The task has been simplified into a binary classification problem where the images are classified into breccia and non-breccia. This research shows that a 5-layer CNN achieves 89.43{\%} classification accuracy for this task.},

@article{BARRETT1980,
abstract = {An attempt was made to distinguish aspects of the shape of rock particles, and to discover by analysis and empirical considerations the most appropriate parameters for describing these aspects. The shape of a rock particle can be expressed in terms of three independent properties: form (overall shape), roundness (large‐scale smoothness) and surface texture. These form a three‐tiered hierarchy of observational scale, and of response to geological processes. Form can be represented by only two independent measures from the three orthogonal axes normally measured. Of the four pairs of independent measures commonly used for bivariate plots, the two sphericity/shape factor pairs appear to be more efficient discriminators than simple axial ratios. Of the two, the most desirable pair is the maximum projection sphericity and oblate‐prolate index for both measures show an arithmetic normal distribution for the range investigated. A measure of form that is independent of the three orthogonal axes, and measures derived from them, is the angularity measure of Lees. Roundness has measures of three types, those estimating average roundness of corners, those based on the sharpest corner, and a measure of convexity in the particle outline. Although each type measures a different aspect, they are not independent of each other. Only roundness from corners is considered in detail. As neither average nor sharpest corner measures are inherently more objective or more quantitative, purpose should determine which is more appropriate. Of the visual comparison charts for average roundness, Krumbein's appears best. The Modified Wentworth roundness is the most satisfactory for estimating roundness from the sharpest corner. The Cailleux Roundness index should not be used because it includes aspects of roundness and form. Shape is a difficult parameter to use for solving sedimentological problems. Even the best of the commonly used procedures are limited by observational subjectivity and a low discriminating power. Unambiguous interpretation of particle shape in terms of source material and processes will always be made difficult by the large number of natural variables and their interactions. For ancient sediments satisfactory results can be expected only from carefully planned studies or rather unusual geological situations. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

Although R and S have well-established mathematical definitions dating back to the 1930s, the values are much more typically estimated using charts developed in the 1940s and 1950s. The charts, are based on the earlier mathematical definitions. Using these charts, a class of undergraduate civil engineering students at the University of Michigan were asked to estimate (Rc and Sc) from images of twenty geologically and geographically diverse sands spanning a range of actual R and S values. The images were of three-dimensional (3D) assemblies of the sands as they would be found in images taken remotely or in situ. The students' estimates were statistically analyzed and compared with rigorously determined R and S using a recently developed computational geometry algorithm. Overall, the students' estimates were scattered, particularly for natural sands exhibiting intermediate values of R and low values of S. On average, the students underestimated Rc and Sc. Reasons for the diverse responses and underestimates of the actual R and S are proposed.},

@article{DIEPENBROEK1992,
abstract = {Numerous methods for roundness measurement have been developed. None, however, has been generally accepted, because of conceptual and practical deficiencies. Modern image processing and Fourier grain shape analysis have eliminated the practical shortcomings, but the conceptual ones remained. Single, higher harmonics of the Fourier series, for example, fail to serve as reliable equivalents for roundness evaluation. The concept outlined in this paper recognizes three criteria for the evaluation of roundness. (1) All curvatures, convex as well as concave or plane elements, must be considered. (2) The positions of morphological elements are significant because salient parts of a particle are more easily abraded than protected ones. Consequently, the curvatures have to be weighted by their relative position on the particle. (3) Positions and curvatures of morphological elements have to be compared with the particle's ultimate abraded shape, which is assumed to be an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid reflects the aspect of form or sphericity. The distinction between sphericity and roundness is retained because there is no evidence that sphericity changes significantly during transport. The measurement is based on the outline of a particle's maximum projection plane, which is transformed to a Fourier series. Roundness data are derived from the complete amplitude spectrum. The aspect of sphericity is eliminated by subtracting the amplitude spectrum of the best approximating ellipse from the spectrum of the empirical shape. The residual amplitudes are normalized and summed. In a final step the resulting values are rescaled. This guarantees reasonable boundaries and a normal distribution of roundness values. The procedure is automated and its efficiency permits the calculation of large samples. Tests on fluvial and coastal gravel populations demonstrate that the method is sensitive to abrasional wear during all stages of roundness. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {A small but important body of geomechanics literature now exists to show qualitatively that whether a specimen is composed of particles that are bulky or platy can have a significant effect on its behaviour during compression and shear. This particle shape characteristic has been termed 'form', which has sometimes been estimated on the basis of 'sphericity', a measure of how close a given particle form comes to that of a sphere. To assess the effects of form it will be necessary to develop and evaluate simple, practical, and robust three-dimensional measures of this aspect of particle shape. This paper reviews experimental evidence on the importance of particle form, and examines previous definitions of it. It then considers potential methods of obtaining data to define the three dimensional form of coarse particles, and proposes a practical method (based on a volumetric equivalent scalene ellipsoid) by which this can be done. The proposed method is applied to specimens with different particle shapes, and the results are assessed by comparison with other possible measures of form, and against the results obtained from orthogonal measurements made using static imaging.},

abstract = {Definitions of soil particle sphericity, roundness and roughness have existed since at least the 1930s. In the 1950s, charts of typical sphericity and roundness values were developed to alleviate tedious manual determination. They allowed users to classify particles by visual comparison to typical particles possessing ranges of sphericity and roundness. The original definitions and somewhat subjective chart methods are still widely used today. This paper describes robust numerical methods based on computational geometry to determine precisely the traditional values from two-dimensional images of particles. Statistical methods including locally weighted regression and K-fold cross-validation were used to discretise a mean particle surface and thereby quantify and remove roughness. The paper details the algorithms for identifying particle corners and fitting circles to them for computation of roundness. Conclusions are also drawn regarding the most appropriate definition for particle sphericity from among five that are commonly cited. Finally, recommendations are made for the minimum image resolutions and particle perimeter discretisation necessary to obtain accurate results.},

Despite a large literature on the subject, there remains widespread confusion regarding the meaning and relative value of different measures of particle shape. This paper re-examines the basic concepts of particle shape and suggests a number of new and modified methods which are widely applicable to a range of sedimentological problems; it is shown that the most important aspects of particle form are represented by the I/L ratio (elongation ratio) and S/I ratio (flatness ratio). A combination of these two ratios can be used to classify particles in terms of 25 form classes. A method of obtaining a quantitative measure of particle roundness using simple image analysis software is described, and a new visual roundness comparator is presented. It is recommended that measurements of both roundness and circularity (a proxy measure of sphericity) are made on grain images in three orthogonal orientations and average values calculated for each particle. A further shape property, irregularity, is defined and a classification scheme proposed for use in describing and comparing irregular or branching sedimentary particles such as chert and coral. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

The objective roundness measures are mainly based on the Fourier transform. In this paper granulometric methods are proposed as alternative objective methods. In fact, we show that even a single morphological opening with a disk of adequately chosen radius can provide a roundness measure that is highly correlated with the “objective ” roundness, as provided by Krumbein's chart [5]. In addition, we propose an efficient alternative method based on a linear opening of the polar representation of the boundary of the particles considered.

Results were in excellent agreement with values published in traditional roundness and sphericity charts, thus confirming that the computational method can replace the much slower and less objective chart methods. Complete volume-based distributions of particle roundness and sphericity were presented for three soils with vastly different particle shapes. Values of R and S obtained from images of three-dimensional assemblies were almost indistinguishable from values obtained using images of detached particles showing their largest projected areas. Mean R values were also computed for 10 different soils of various geologic origins. As expected, crushed sands exhibited the smallest mean values of R whereas alluvial and glacio-fluvial soils showed the largest values.},
